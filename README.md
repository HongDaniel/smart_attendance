# Introduction


 Most of the organizations have their own system to keep track of attendance of their students or employees. Some take attendance with a sheet of paper by calling out names during the class or  work whereas some use fingerprint or card reader machines. However these conventional ways of attendance have many problems such as card loss, machine flaws and waste of time. Using face recognition for attendance is a smart way to solve these problems. This program is very accurate, fast and convenient compared to other techniques and also it can be used in various ways other than just attendance.
